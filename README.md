Kaggle is currently hosting an open data scientist competition titled “2018 Kaggle ML & DS 
Survey Challenge.” The purpose of this challenge is to “tell a data story about a subset of the 
data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text 
and data exploration.” Kaggle is providing 6 monetary prizes for the best data storytelling 
submissions. More information on the competition, data, and prizes can be found on: 
https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018 

The purpose of this project is to 
1) understand and explore employment in the data science community, as represented in a survey 
conducted by Kaggle. 
2) train, validate, and tune multiple regressors that can predict, given a set of survey responses by 
a data scientist, what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation is.

Objectives: 
1. Understand how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, including working with 
multiple data types, incomplete data, and categorical data. 
2. Understand how to explore data to look for correlations between the features and the 
target variable. 
3. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of 
regression/prediction.
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to compare the performance of prediction 
algorithms, including application of performance measurements, statistical hypothesis 
testing, and visualization of comparisons. 
5. Understand how to improve the performance of your model. 
6. Improve on skill and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, 
evidence-based insights.
